<b>Adrianne 2017-11-13</b>:<br>Best pancakes I've ever had! What's even better is that they're so easy to make, yet taste so good :D<p hidden>1510928106,Adrianne</p><br><br>
<b>Bob 2017-11-15</b>:<br>The work needed to prepare this meal is awarded with delicious, good looking pancakes! I tried 2 tablespoons of sugar instead of 1 and did not use any salt, truly elevated the sweet taste of the otherwise  still tasteful pancakes.. <p hidden>1510928510,Bob</p><br><br>
